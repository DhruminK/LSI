# Latent Semantic Indexing

This repository is a very basic python implementation of LSI model. LSI model is used to convert documents of sentences into vector-based model and finding out similarity between vectors using cosine similarity. This python implementation of LSI model uses Flask framework to make itself available as a web app.
# Features!

  - Uses POS tagger and Named-Entity Regconition to find names, dates, etc in sentences
  - Applies LSI model to convert pre-processed words to vectors



### Tech

Knowledge-Based Authentication uses technologies like 

* [Python] - Because where will you find nltk
* [nltk] - How can you use something else
* [PPrint] - To print those System print beautifully, or we would stuck with those normal prints ugh!!
* [Flask] - Django was too much for such a project
* [JSON] - This ain't Javascript
* [Gensim] - Provides function to load LSI models and many other things
### Installation

LSI requires [Python] v2.7+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd BE_Project
$ pip install flask, nltk
$ python run.py
```
